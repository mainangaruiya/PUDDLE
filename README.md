# Django Project - Puddle

A web application built with Django, providing features for managing conversations, items, and dashboards. This project uses an SQLite database and includes functionality for managing items, user profiles, and more.

## Features

- **Conversation Management**: Users can view, send, and manage conversations.
- **Item Management**: CRUD operations on items.
- **Dashboard**: Overview of user activity and statistics.
- **User Authentication**: Includes login and signup functionality.
- **Media Uploads**: Users can upload images associated with items.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Django 4.x
- SQLite (default database)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` is not yet available, you can manually install the necessary dependencies such as:

   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:

   If you're using environment variables (e.g., for database configurations, API keys, etc.), create a `.env` file in the root of your project with your configurations.

5. **Apply migrations**:

   Run the following command to apply the initial migrations for the database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Create a superuser** (for admin access):

   To access the Django admin panel, create a superuser account:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set the username, email, and password.

7. **Run the development server**:

   Now, you can start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   You can access the application by navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser.
